Comments on commands

TiffRead
	parameter - Fn - Filename
	
	-The TiffRead command simply takes a tiff file with filename fn and displays it in a window. Use the checkimage
		array in the supplied main.c to do this. You are not expected to be able to read in all tiff files, see below

	-implement the specification for: 8-bit grayscale uncompressed, and 24-bit RGB uncompressed.

TiffWrite
	parameter - Fn - Filename
	parameter - x0, y0, xc, yc - bounding box coords (unsigned ints (size_t))

	-implement the specification for: 8-bit grayscale uncompressed, and 24-bit RGB uncompressed.

	-The TiffWrite command writes a tiff file with file name fn and fills it with pixels formed by the box (x0, y0, xc, yc)
		of the last image read in by TiffRead.

	-The box is specified by the pixel coordinates of the lower left hand vertex (the origin) and the upper right hand vertex (the corner) of the box. 

	-Note that TiffWrite can only work after TiffRead has been called as the file type of what is written must be same as what was read. 
		-Check for null vars?
	-If you read in an 8 bit grayscale image, you must write an 8 bit grayscale image.

TiffStat - WRITE FIRST
	parameter - Fn - Filename

	- If the file is not a Tiff File, it informs you
	
	-OTHERWISE (it is a tiff -> ALL TIFFS)-
	- Prints out the tiff tag entries and values of the file Fn.
	-Does NOT print out colormap or image.
	- if the values are stored in the offset. You should parse the values if it is reasonable to do
		so, e.g., SamplesPerPixel. For other values where it is not reasonably to print out the values, such as a private tag, then
		you can simply print out the offset.

Other Info:
- When testing, test with small images. You are not required to support an image greater than 1024x1024 if you don’t
want to (but your program should gracefully decline to handle a larger image). (0,0) for OpenGL (and Direct3D) is in
the lower left hand corner of the window.

- you can ignore any optional fields that were associated with the file that you read in

- you are not required to handle more than one IFD per file, although the Tiff specification requires that the IFD contain the address of the “next IFD” as its last 4 bytes. You can make this a long zero.

- The format of TIFF image data is described on pages 37 and 38 of the TIFF spec, under PhotometricInterpretation
and PlanarConfiguration. Note that a baseline TIFF reader only has to support PlanarConfiguration=1. If SamplesPerPixel
is greater than three, you can throw away the extra bytes or you can generate a diagnostic message and do
nothing.

-Check .tifstat file against image

Testing
• TiffStat all the images.
• TiffRead all the images which are 8-bit grayscale uncompressed and 24-bit RGB uncompressed.
• TiffWrite an image of your own choosing.
• TiffRead your own written images.
